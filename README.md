# USGS Earthquake Visualization Project Overview

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is on a mission to provide vital scientific data about natural hazards, ecosystem health, climate change impacts, and more. As stewards of Earth's data, they seek to develop innovative tools to visualize their earthquake data and educate the public and government organizations on pressing planetary issues.

## Overview
Organized directories for Leaflet-Part-1 to correspond to project challenges.

## Earthquake Visualization
- Obtained earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed page.
- Imported and visualized earthquake data using Leaflet.
- Plotted earthquakes on a map based on their longitude and latitude.
- Adjusted marker size to reflect earthquake magnitude and color to represent depth.
- Implemented popups to provide additional information about each earthquake.
- Designed a legend to contextualize map data.
